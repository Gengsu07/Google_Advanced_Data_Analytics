#### **EDA involves six key practices: DSCJVP**

- Discovering: Familiarizing yourself with the data and asking questions about it.
- Structuring: Organizing and transforming raw data for easier visualization, explanation, or modeling.
- Cleaning: Removing errors and inconsistencies from the data set.
- Joining: Adding values from other data sets to enrich the data.
- Validating: Verifying the data's consistency and quality.
- Presenting: Sharing the cleaned data set or data visualizations with others for further analysis or modeling.

### **Explore raw data**

- Understanding the data source is crucial: This helps you determine the reliability of the data and who to contact if you have questions.
- Knowing the data source, format, and type helps you answer two key questions: Does the data align with the project plan? Do you have enough data to follow through with the plan?

- Second-party data
  Data that was gathered outside your organization but directly from the original source
